    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  66,080    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      1
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         1

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    27 out of  56,880    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           76
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            37 out of      76   48%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               8 out of 455,040    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
