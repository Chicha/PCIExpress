This directory contains the setup guide .pdf and the necessary top level and 
adapter modules for a RIFFA 2.0 reference design.

The RIFFA 2.0 reference design connects a chnl_tester module to each channel 
as an example of how to use channels. This chnl_tester module works with the 
sample sofware applications provided in the distribution. You don't need either
chnl_tester or the sample software applications in your designs. It only 
provided as an example. You can see where to replace the chnl_tester module in 
the RIFFA 2.0 adapter module. That should really be the only file you need to 
modify.
